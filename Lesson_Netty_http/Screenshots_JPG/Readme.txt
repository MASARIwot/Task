Program logic write in such way that she can work with many different IP!
(In my screenshot only my IP ,because I testing program only for my pc. - in result I have only one row  ). 
Program  can collect all information for each IP. You can see it in package "box",
(logic of collecting information) . Logic of /status in package "statusLogic". 
Server configuration in package  "serverNetty". In package "statusLogic" logic of printing information 
and Class-AddPersoneThread- what add person)  And for testing server I writed test in package"Test"(src\test\java\test). 
Test is run diferent Thread and they send request to the server.
